I can barely breathe up here.
The air is so thick with dust, I can taste the last century on my tongue.
This whole attic feels like his tomb.
Alistair.
My great-grandfather.
Whenever my family speaks his name, it's always followed by a sigh.
The man who chased a dream into the sea and never came home.
A family tragedy.
An obsession that cost him everything.
But I never believed he was justâ€¦ gone.
And here it is. Proof.
His journal.
My hand is almost trembling just holding it.
What if they were right? What if there's nothing in here but the final, desperate ramblings of a man lost to the waves?
They always said his notes were pure madness.
A private language of strange maps and symbols that led nowhere.
But maybe, buried in that chaos, there are clues.
A pattern that I can figure out if I just look closely enough.
There's only one way to find out.
