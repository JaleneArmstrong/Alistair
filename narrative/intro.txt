For years, my family has spoken of him in hushed tones: Alistair, my great-grandfather.
The brilliant explorer who chased a myth and vanished without a trace a century ago.
Today, in a dusty chest in the attic, I found it. His final journal.
Its pages are filled with strange maps and cryptic notes of a language all his own.
He was on the verge of finding the legendary Sunken City. He left a trail.
It's time to finish his journey.
