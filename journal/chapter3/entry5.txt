The air grows thick and heavy. The swamp lies before me, a festering mire of mud and tangled roots. The villagers say it is impassable, a place where the earth swallows you whole. But they forget the wisdom of the woods that border this place. The forest does not hoard its secrets; it gives freely to those who know how to ask. Its ancient timber will provide the means for a crossing. I will not be deterred.
