The air… thick. Heavy. The Serpent is before me… not roaring now, but a festering mire of mud and tangled root.
They whisper it is impassab…le. That the earth swallows men whole.
They forget the wisdom of the silent giants that choke its banks.
The fallen ones do not hoard secrets… they offer their strength to one who knows how to ask.
Their bones will grant me passage. I will not be det…rred.
