Success! It is true. The wind here… it speaks.
A lonely song, yes, but it sings of what's to come.
The guides were not madmen.
These stone teeth rise like a fo…tress… a wall to keep the world out.
And from this perch, I see the path.
Not of stone, but a silver artery, pulsing with light as it spills down from the highlands.
It pulls n…rth. Tomorrow, I follow its pulse home.
