Iâ€™ve left the Grey-Cliff Outpost behind. The air here is thin, and the silence is absolute. This is where the world's maps end and my own must begin. The indigenous guides I spoke with have a beautiful name for the flatlands ahead: the 'Whispering Plains,' where the wind tells its stories. But they warned me to stay clear of the 'Sleeping Giants' that rise in jagged clusters, impassable and cold. My first campsite lies just beyond them. I must find a way through.
