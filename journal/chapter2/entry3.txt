This page is stained, a testament to the river's spray. The locals call it the 'Great Serpent,' a force of nature too powerful to be tamed or crossed. They build their humble homes only where the river gives life, clinging to its banks for survival. There is a small village further along its path where I can resupply. I must be careful not to get cornered by the water's edge.
