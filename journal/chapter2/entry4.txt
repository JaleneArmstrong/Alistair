The villagers are wary, but kind. They shared their food and their stories. They speak of the Sunken City—Itacuna, the 'Place of Water and Stone'—but their faces cloud over with fear. They warn that the path is guarded by 'choking swamps' that no one can cross. A fool's errand, they say. I am just the fool to try.
