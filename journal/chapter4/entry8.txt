I stand at the threshold… and the puzzle is complete.
I came seeking a destination, but the path itself was the true discov…ery. The land's own tongue, written in the Serpent's flow and the bones of the earth.
The old ones… their maps were not for conquest, but to… commune. This is the wisdom I was meant to find.
My work is not over… it has just begun. This city is a library of silence and stone… and I its first student.
But I am old… my hand shakes as I write this. I cannot finish this al…one.
This journal. My maps. A trail of bread…crumbs. Left for one of my blood… my spirit… to follow.
If you are reading this… then my hope was not in vain. The legend is not finished. It is now… yours.
