I have reached the city's edge, and my understanding is finally complete. I came seeking a destination, but the real discovery was the journeyâ€”the language of this land, written in rivers and stone.
The indigenous people did not draw maps to conquer land, but to commune with it. This is the wisdom I was meant to find. My work is not done; it has just begun. This city is a library of knowledge, and I am its first student. But I am old, and my hand begins to shake. I cannot finish this alone. I have left my journal and my maps as a trail of breadcrumbs, hoping that someone with my blood and my spirit would one day follow. If you are reading this, then my hope was not in vain. The legend is not finished. Now, it is yours to write.
