I have found it. Or rather, the path has found me. The Sunken City is not a place of gold, but of silence. The final approach is a secret kept by the landscape itself—a puzzle of river, stone, and root. One does not simply walk in; the land guides you, if you listen to its story. All the lessons of my journey—the nature of the mountains, the flow of the river, the secret of the forest—it all comes together here. This is the final key.
