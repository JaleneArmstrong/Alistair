I did not find it. The path… it delivered me.
The Sunken City is not a place of gold… but of silence.
An ancient, heavy silence. The final approach is a secret the land itself keeps… a puzzle of serpent, stone, and tangled root.
You do not simply walk in. The land… it guides you, if you know how to listen.
The lesson of the stone teeth… the pulse of the Serpent… the secret of the green jaws… it all converges here.
One single ans…wer. The final key.
